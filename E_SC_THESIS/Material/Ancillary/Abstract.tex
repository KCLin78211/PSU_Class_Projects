This thesis examines the effects of print orientation, infill amounts, and structure shape on the strength, modulus of elasticity and uncertainty of additive manufacturing during multiple phases of testing. Square and rectangular beam structures that are studied are created from both PLA and ABS under the conjecture that the outer shell walls provide the majority of the strength to the objects are tested in Phase I. Phase II examines deviations in the modulus of elasticity and uncertainty due to print orientation in 100\% in-fill I-beams made from PLA. Uncertainty caused by deviation of prints from nominal measurements is also examined.
