@article{Shreepad2015,
abstract = {Abstract The fundamentally different features of Rapid prototyping (RP) from that of conventional sintering offerus some new approaches to develop materials with excellent properties. Applying this method, porous Hydroxyapatite (Hap) ceramics, as well as the HAp-zirconia composites have been fabricated successfully. Porous hydroxyapatite (Hap) is expected to have desired mechanical and biological properties for biomedical applications. However, due to material processing problems, to date, this material can only be prepared by conventional techniques. Fuse deposition Machine is modified to fabricate Hap conventional support structure is not required three nozzle system is utilized for fabrication. Main nozzle is provided with heating arrangement. Two nozzles provided for transient Hap and solvent. Three stages heating with two lasers arrangement for gradual temperature change so transformation is faster .Primary result shows mechanical properties and porosity is as per bone structure. The micro structural characterizations such as phase purity and composition of porous {\{}BCP{\}} granules were performed and verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis. The chemical and the microstructure information of the Fabricated Hap were investigated by FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infra-Red), {\{}SEM{\}} (Scanning Electron Microscopy), X-ray Diffraction (XRD). Result shows interconnected regular pores and uniformly distribution of Hap. There is covalent boding makes stronger adhesion to prosthetic. Using this technique, it is possible to produce scaffolds with mechanical and structural properties close to those of the natural bone and teeth. The prepared scaffold has an open, regular pattern and uniformly interconnected porous structure. Some extent problem of small Nano particle aggregate together is called Balling and product of different temperature solidify on the layer is called recasting is dominates the process. By optimizing the operating parameter these problem can be minimized. },

@article{Rayna2015,
abstract = {The aim of this article is to investigate the changes brought about by online 3D printing platforms in co-creation and user innovation. As doing so requires a thorough understanding of the level of user involvement in productive processes and a clear view of the nature of co-creative processes, this article provides a ‘prosumption' framework and a typology of co-creation activities. Then, based on case studies of 22 online 3D printing platforms, a service-based taxonomy of these platforms is constructed. The taxonomy and typology are then matched to investigate the role played by online 3D platforms in regard to the various types of co-creation activities and, consequently, how this impacts user innovation.},

@article{Weller2015,
abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), colloquially known as 3D printing, is currently being promoted as the spark of a new industrial revolution. The technology allows one to make customized products without incurring any cost penalties in manufacturing as neither tools nor molds are required. Moreover, AM enables the production of complex and integrated functional designs in a one-step process, thereby also potentially reducing the need for assembly work. In this article, we discuss the impact of AM technology at both firm and industry level. Our intention is to discern how market structures will be affected from an operations management perspective. Based on an analysis of established economic models, we first identify the economic and technological characteristics of AM and distill four key principles relevant to manufacturers at firm level. We then critically assess the effects of AM at industry level by analyzing the validity of earlier assumptions in the models when these four principles apply. In so doing, we derive a set of seven propositions which provide impetus for future research. In particular, we propose that in a monopoly, the adoption of AM allows a firm to increase profits by capturing consumer surplus when flexibly producing customized products. Meanwhile in competitive markets, competition is spurred as AM may lower barriers to market entry and offers the ability to serve multiple markets at once. This should ultimately result in lower prices for consumers.},
