abstract = {These test methods cover the tension testing of metallic materials in any form at room temperature, specifically, the methods of determination of yield strength, yield point elon- gation, tensile strength, elongation, and reduction of area. 1.2 The gage lengths for most round specimens are required to be 4D for E8 and 5D for E8M. The gage length is the most significant difference between E8 and E8M Test Specimens Test specimens made from powder metallurgy (P/M) materials are exempt from this requirement by industry-wide agreement to keep the pressing of the material to a specific projected area and density. 1.3 Exceptions to the provisions of these test methods may need to be made in individual specifications or test methods for a particular material. For examples, see Test Methods and Definitions A370 and Test Methods B557, and B557M. 1.4 Room temperature shall be considered to be 10 to 38C 50 to 100F unless otherwise specified. 1.5 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as separate from inch/pound units. The values stated in each system are not exact equivalents; therefore each system must be used independently of the other. Combining values from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the standard. 1.6 This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro- priate safety and health practices and determine the applica- bility of regulatory limitations prior to use. 2.
