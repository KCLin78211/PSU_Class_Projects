abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) is starting to replace conventional manufacturing processes where complex parts with small lead-time and lot sizes are needed. As conventional test methods are not suitable for AM parts, new standard specimens and test procedures have to be defined. This work undertakes some efforts to progress the design of specimens for mechanical tests. A methodology for tensile tests of AM specimens made from one layer is proposed and verified on an example. It identifies challenges during the design and manufacturing of Fused Layer Modeling single layer specimens.},

@article{Ahn2003,
abstract = {Stratasys' Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is a typical Rapid Prototyping (RP) process that can fabricate prototypes out of plastic materials, and the parts made from FDM were often used as load-carrying elements. Because FDM deposits materials in about 300 gm thin filament with designated orientation, parts made from FDM show anisotropic material behaviors. This paper proposes an analytic model to predict the tensile strength of FDM parts. Applying the Classical Lamination Theory and Tsai-Wu failure criterion, which were developed for laminated composite materials, a computer code was implemented to predict the failure of the FDM parts. The tensile strengths predicted by the analytic model were compared with those of the experimental data. The data and predicted values agreed reasonably well to prove the validity of the model.},

abstract = {A study was conducted to evaluate the current production capabilities of the Mark One{\textregistered} 3D printer in printing carbon fibre reinforced thermoplastic (CFRTP) tensile test specimens according to the JIS K 7073 by making use of fused deposition modelling. Several different types of CFRTP tensile test specimens are printed and are tensile tested in the longitudinal direction to obtain an overview of the mechanical properties of 3D printed CFRTP material. These properties are compared with the literature values known for composite materials to see if these agree. The main goal of this research is to increase the knowledge of the 3D printing process of CFRTP and to later use this knowledge to further improve the 3D printing process to obtain stronger 3D printed CFRTP materials.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to estimate the measurement uncertainty for a material produced by additive manufacturing. The material investigated was FullCure 720 photocured resin, which was applied to fabricate tensile specimens with a Connex 350 3D printer based on PolyJet technology. The tensile strength of the specimens established through static tensile testing was used to determine the measurement uncertainty. There is a need for extensive research into the performance of model materials obtained via 3D printing as they have not been studied sufficiently like metal alloys or plastics, the most common structural materials. In this analysis, the measurement uncertainty was estimated using a larger number of samples than usual, i.e., thirty instead of typical ten. The results can be very useful to engineers who design models and finished products using this material. The investigations also show how wide the scatter of results is.},

@article{TorradoPerez2014,
abstract = {One of the most common materials utilized by material extrusion 3D printing is acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). The work presented in this research explored the effect of the addition of reinforcing materials on the mechanical properties of ABS in an effort to create materials with enhanced physical properties. A comparison was made between pure ABS, two ABS matrix composites, and one ABS/elastomer blend with the purpose of characterizing the effect of additives on the mechanical properties. Tensile test results of specimens built in different orientations showed that ABS reinforced with 5{\%} by weight TiO 2 exhibited the highest ultimate tensile strength for specimens built in both horizontal and vertical directions with 32.2 and 18.4 MPa, respectively. The compounding of an elastomeric material with ABS improved the surface finish of parts as they were visibly smoother compared to those printed from the ABS baseline material, though there was an observable decrease in the ductility of tensile specimens. Analysis was performed on the fracture surface of the tensile specimens through the use of scanning electron microscopy. Fractography revealed different modes of failure related to the different additives. The effects of additives on the anisotropy associated with the mechanical properties of 3D-printed parts were also analyzed.},

@article{Alharbi2016,
abstract = {STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The application of 3-dimensional printing technology is emerging in dentistry and is being increasingly used to fabricate dental restorations. To date, scientific evidence is lacking regarding the effect of different factors on the mechanical properties of the printed restorations with the additive manufacturing technique. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of build direction (layer orientation) on the mechanical properties of a novel 3-dimensionally (3D)-printed dental restorative material. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on the printing direction, 2 groups were tested. In the first group (n=20), the specimens were vertically printed with the layers oriented perpendicular to the load direction. In the second group (n=20), the specimens were horizontally printed with the layers oriented parallel to the load direction. All specimens were fabricated using the DW028D 3D-printer. The specimens were loaded with a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min with a 10-kN load cell. The test was performed at room temperature (22 degrees C) under dry testing conditions. The compressive strength was calculated for both groups, and the results were compared using the unpaired t test (alpha=.05). RESULTS: The mean +/-SD compressive strength for the vertically printed specimens was 297 MPa (+/-34) compared with 257 MPa (+/-41) for the horizontally printed specimens (P=.002). CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this study, the layer orientation was found to influence the compressive strength of the material. Vertically printed specimens with the layers oriented perpendicular to load direction have improved mechanical properties more than horizontally printed specimens with the layers oriented parallel to load direction.},
