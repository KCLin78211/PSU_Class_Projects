NOTE: Non-portable document will be produced. The current settings of FORMCHAR
      use nonstandard line-drawing characters and the resulting output file
      will not render correctly unless all readers of the document have the SAS
      Monospace font installed. To make your document portable, issue the
      following command:
      OPTIONS FORMCHAR="|----|+|---+=|-/\<>*";
