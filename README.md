# Hello! Please read me for clarification.
## Welcome to my class project/assignment code repository.

This repository contains code for projects for classes during my attendance at Penn State and consists of various languages.

### The breakdown of code is as follows:

* __Matlab:__
	* _AERSP 308H_ - Fluid Dynamics
	* _E SC 407H_ - Interpolation methods (Gaussian, RK, Trapezoidal, etc.) and ODE Solutions
* __C#:__
	* _CMPSC 360_ - Caesar Cipher w/ salting function
* __C++:__
	* _CMPSC 122_ - Various introductory C++ projects ranging from class basics to building hash functions and binary trees.
	* _CMPSC 360_ - Truth Table Generator, Pseudo-"Neural Network" pathfinder, and Incomplete Dijkstra (using Boost)
* __Python:__
	* _CMPSC 360_ - Automated algorithm where a robot tries to collect all of the gold on a board before a bomb destroys it.
* __LaTeX:__
	* _CMPSC 360_ - Homework documentation.	
    * _E SC THESIS_ - Engineering Science Capstone Research: Studies the effects of fill density, size and print orientation on PLA and ABS 3D printed objects.
