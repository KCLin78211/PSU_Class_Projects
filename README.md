# Hello! Please read me for clarification.
## Welcome to my class project/assignment code repository.

This repository contains code for projects for classes during my attendance at Penn State consisting of various programming and scripting languages as well as LaTeX documents.

## __Unless otherwise specified within a directory's readme file, all work was completed solely by myself.__

### The breakdown of each course is as follows:
* __COURSE:__ _(Language)_ Course Description
    * Project


* __CMPSC 122:__ _(C++)_ Intermediate Programming
    * Various introductory C++ projects ranging from class basics to building hash functions and binary trees
* __CMPSC 360:__ _(C++, C#, Python)_ Discrete Math
    * _(C#)_ Caesar Cipher w/ salting function
    * _(C++)_ Truth table generator, lowest edge cost pathfinder, Dijkstra's algorithm, Knapsack algorithm
    * _(Python)_ Randomly generates and prints out a game board with a robot, moving bomb, and gold pieces where the robot attempts to collect all gold before the bomb destroys it.
    * _(LaTeX)_ Homework documents
* __CMPSC 431W:__ _(C)_ Database Management Systems
    * _(C)_ Re-creating an SQL-like database management structure in C including:
        * CREATE/DROP TABLE
        * SELECT, FROM, WHERE
        * INSERT
        * JOIN (implicitly joins when multiple tables are in from clause)
        * Creating temporary tables to cache reused queries
    * _(Python)_ Data generator for tables, data parser for SQL-lite output, beautifier for creating a weekly schedule & report based on data output
    * _(LaTeX)_ Homework documents
* __CMPSC 450:__ _(C, C++, OpenMP)_ Concurrent Scientific Programming
    * _(C)_ Vector Triad benchmark test
    * _(C++, OpenMP)_ Binary tree and Divide & Conquer parallel sum implementations
    * _(C, OpenMPI)_ Game of life implementation with scalable parameters. Analysis on computation & communication times
    * _(C, CUDA)_ Prefix Sum with CUDA
