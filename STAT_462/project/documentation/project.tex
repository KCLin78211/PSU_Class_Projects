\section*{Data Set Introduction}
The data being investigated concerns the performance statistics, salaries, free agency and arbitration in the 1991-1992 season and contains 337 total observations. The data was obtained from an online repository and has been cited from the following sources: CNN Sports Illustrated, Sacramento Bee, and the New York Times. The following variables are included in the data with units in parentheses:
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0em}
	\item Salary (Thousands of Dollars)
	\item Batting Average (\%)
	\item On-base Percentage or OBP (\%)
	\item Counts of: Runs, Hits, Doubles, Triples, Home Runs, runs batted in or RBI, Walks, Strike-outs, Stolen Bases, and Errors
	\item Categorical Indication of: "free agency eligibility", "free agent in 1991/2", "arbitration eligibility", and "arbitration in 1991/2"
	\item Player's name
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-1em}
\subsection*{Research Questions}
The following questions will be explored:
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0em}
	\item Is OBP a good prediction of salary?
	\item Does using the individual predictors that comprise OBP create a stronger model?
	\item How well does our model handle predicting actual salaries?
\end{itemize}

The models below will be used to conduct our tests on the stated questions.

		\text{Salary}_{Expanded}= & \beta_0 + \beta_1\text{Runs} + \beta_2\text{Strike-outs} + \beta_3\text{StolenBases} + \beta_4\text{Singles}        \\

\subsection*{Summary}
Below is the summary of our data using R.

\subsection*{Errors}
Looking into the summary statistics, it can be observed that the minimum of Hits is equal to -12, which indicates a likely error. This data point corresponds to Bo Jackson records. This player's observations will be removed from the data set due to this finding.

\subsection*{Correlations}
The following values were obtained for the correlation between the variables.

\subsection*{Scatter Plots}
The first figure includes the scatter plots that concern the $Salary_{OBP}$ model and the second includes the scatter plots introduced in the $Salary_{Expanded}$ model.

\subsection*{Data Distribution}
From our data distribution one can see non-normal data will be an issue to deal with.
