# Hello! Please read me for clarification.
## This section of my repository contains GDDs and One-Pagers for class projects. The context of each game is detailed below.
### Disclaimer: Please excuse any of my horrible drawing/artwork. Although I started off as a Saxophone Performance major, my visual art skills are severely lacking :)
* __Gravity:__ For this project we were required to create an idea for a simple game with gravity as the main mechanic
* __One Letter:__ The task given was to design a game's mechanics around your interpretation of "one letter," (i.e. One alphabetical letter vs written letter, etc.) in any genre
* __Un-Engineered:__ We were given a set of photographs and had to choose one as the sole inspiration for a game. The photograph chosen for this game idea was an image of a crashed plane
* __Insomnia:__ The purpose of the project was to design a small game around insomnia in order to portray negative emotions
* __Greirat's Thieving Adventures:__ The assignment here was to take a side-character from any game and create a new world and game around that person, along with using a game design document (GDD) format. The character chosen was Greirat from Dark Souls III
* __One Button Hero:__ This project was to test our creativity by limiting the amount of interaction the players are allowed to have with the game. The stipulation for this assignment was that the players only have a single button to press
* __Rapid Release:__  Satire was the goal of this project. We were instructed to find an aspect of the current video games industry and conceive an idea for a game that exaggerated that aspect, much like the game DLC Quest
* __Final Project (Parallax):__ The final project was to come up a game of your choosing, write a Game Design Document, Technical Design Document, and create a prototype of that game. The source is not open for my project as purchased assets were used, however a YouTube playlist documenting some of the project is available [here].(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxuQyBxXjAY&list=PLJCbmN5AjE1XUlgY5KwFnwDh3gmhvtiSC "Parallax Dev Log Playlist")
