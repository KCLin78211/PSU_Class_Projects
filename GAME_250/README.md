# Hello! Please read me for clarification.
## The documentation here was simply to introduce us to game design documentation (one pagers, beat charts, etc.) and to begin incorporating story elements/character development.
### Disclaimer: Please excuse any of my horrible drawing/artwork. Although I started off as a Saxophone Performance major, my visual art skills are severely lacking :)
* __Proxima:__ Initial game design projects where we were tasked to come up with a mostly novel idea for a game, create a one pager, beat chart, plot, and character information sheet
* __Titan Arena:__ The task for this assignment was to create a one-pager for a boss arena battle game
* __Dungeon Disaster:__ Our project was to design a game around dungeon crawling to accompany in-class efforts
